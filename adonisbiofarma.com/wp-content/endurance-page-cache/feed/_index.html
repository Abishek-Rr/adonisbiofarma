										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many local newspapers had online personals in the mid 1990s but were bought out by these big dating sites. From some of the comments it really shows how desperate dating sites are for money that they even advertise in comment sections. You have a much better chance going to local events and you will probably spend less than what you would spend on an online dating site.</p>
<p>Other apps have indicated that they might actually move closer to Facebook. For example, Bumble, founded by a former Tinder executive, said they had already reached out to Facebook regarding how to collaborate. And, “One thing everyone seems to agree on is that Facebook’s effectively endorsing online dating will be a huge legitimization event for the industry,” says Jefferies Internet analyst Brent Thill. According to Amanda Bradford, chief executive of The League, an elite dating app, “Facebook is validating that dating is a high-tech industry with really interesting and hard problems to solve. Still, Facebook could face some obstacles in building enough separation between the dating service and the legacy social network; some users might not like having both activities live on one app.</p>
<p>After giving him some time to cope with his cat passing away, he made plans to see her again and she was thrilled. He canceled the date last minute again because he said his grandma had died. Although this seemed too tragic to be true, she gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was telling the truth. Additionally, if someone is giving you a checklist right away of all of the things they want in a future partner, this may be a red flag for some controlling behaviors. It’s one thing if they express their non-negotiables but it’s another  thing entirely if they are listing required traits. If you feel like someone is already trying to change things about you to suit their needs, that’s not okay. How someone initiates a conversation with you will say a lot about how they view you as a person and how they might treat you as a partner.</p>
<p>Online dating users are more likely to describe their overall experience with using dating sites or apps in positive, rather than negative, terms. Some 57% of Americans who have ever used a dating site or app say their own personal experiences with these platforms have been very or somewhat positive. Still, about four-in-ten online daters (42%) describe their personal experience with dating sites or apps as at least somewhat negative. Happily, there are some dating services that are looking to overcome the vanity. For example, Hinge matches people based on personality and preferences and lets you create a more interesting and rounded profile to draw people in. One of the few dating sites designed for affairs, Ashley Madison connects users for discreet encounters.</p>
<p>Basically all a guy like you has to do is instantly grab her attention in a memorable way with both your profile and your messages, then spend the least amount of time possible convincing her to meet you in person. For those who are hesitant to enter the online dating world for reasons related to safety or awkward conversation lulls, Double aims to take the pressure off with Double dates as opposed to one-on-one.</p>
<p>State things that are really important to you and be done with it. Connor turned an attempt at small talk into a rant about “gold-digging whores,” and the dating app was not having it. Matt- But what about when you said you would meet me in real life and we would lose our virginity together. One Love educates  young people about healthy and unhealthy relationships, empowering them to identify and avoid abuse and learn how to love better. If you are going somewhere that serves alcoholic beverages, most bartenders are using secret codes to help customers signal, privately, when they need help if they’re getting harassed or feeling unsafe on a bad date.</p>
<p>With no financial requirement, free sites will naturally attract a greater proportion of people who are not really committed to finding a genuine relationship. Memberships you gain additional features such as being able to send more messages and receiving event discounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12  col-xs-mobile-fullwidth"><div class="vc_column-inner "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="last-paragraph-no-margin"><p><b>What exactly a cancer stage means?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us would have heard the word “stage of cancer”. Have you wondered what does the word “Stage” in cancer specify? Staging is actually a way that describes the size and growth of the cancer cells in our body. By knowing what stage one is, it means to explain what size is the tumor/cell, whether it has engaged surrounding structures or any related organs too. Numerous types of examinations / screening tests may be used to find out the exact stage of cancer.  The screening might include physical examination, imaging tests, endoscopy exam, A biopsy, and laboratory testing.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is cancer staging important?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there was no cancer staging system, it was going to be very confusing or problematic for doctors to decide the course of treatment as well as the screening. The staging system specifies the required details about the disease so by knowing the stage one can easily understand the severity of the disease and the prognosis. </span></p>
<p><b>Types of cancer staging</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common and widely used system of cancer staging is TNM system.  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends the TNM system of classification to be adopted and used by doctors.</span></p>
<p><b>What is TNM system of cancer staging?</b></p>
<p><b>TNM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system a particular stage of cancer is ermined after a number or a letter is assigned to elaborate the </span><b>T</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">umor </span><b>N</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ode and </span><b>M</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">etastasis.</span></p>
<p><b>T</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains the tumor and its size in the body, it may be 1, 2 3, or 4 where one means denotes small and 4 means large</span></p>
<p><a href="https://demo.adonisbiofarma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-1e702279.png"><img decoding="async" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://demo.adonisbiofarma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-1e702279-555x400.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Source: Epomidicine</span></p>
<p><b>N </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes whether the closely located lymph nodes are affected/involved. It can be anywhere between 0 and 3. Here 0 means no lymph nodes and 3 means lot of lymph nodes involved</span></p>
<p><b>M </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">tells us that the cancer has spread {metastasized} to the other parts of the body. Here it is only 0 or 1, where 0 means no presence of cancer and 1 means presence of cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another clinical system of staging, there are 5 stages of cancer mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><b>Stage 0</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> : Stage 0 means no cancer or the cancer is still non invasive. Patients in stage 0 can be easily managed with the surgery alone and often show excellent prognosis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Stage  1 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stage one denotes the cancer or localized tumor that has not grown significantly deep into the organ or the adjacent tissues</span></p>
<p><b>Stage 2 and 3 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Means the cancer has involved the nearby tissues and the lymph nodes. It also means that the cancer growth has started and may further spread to other organs if not treated. Based upon the number of structures involved it could be named 2 or 3.</span></p>
<p><b>Stage 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also known as the last stage of cancer. Stage 4 means the cancer has spread to the closer as well as distant organs of the body. The prognosis of stage 4 patient is comparatively poor than of those in stage 2 and 3.</span></p>
<p><b>What do we mean by Restaging cancer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical restaging is required during the course of treatment to re- evaluate the extent of recovery which further helps in determining the treatment process. The process of restaging and the tests which are done in restaging are quite similar to the one which were performed initially to diagnose the cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above mentioned system, of staging is actually based upon a variety of clinical examinations as wells as screening tests. So your doctor is always the best person to tell you exactly what stage is you in.</span></p>
<p><b>Is stage 4 cancer a death stage?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A metastatic cancer or stage 4 cancers often means that tumor has involved distant organs of body and is less likely to be cured. But there are patients who have been living with stage 4 cancer along with regular treatment. This means stage 4 patients live for many years but the recovery or prognosis is not that better as in initial stages. </span></p>
<p><b>Cervical cancer staging</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major classification systems in cervical cancer staging.  International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system of classification and The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system. As per these systems cervical cancer can be staged as follows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tx means primary tumor can’t be assessed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T0 means there were no significant evidences of the primary tumor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tis (TNM) means stage 0 (FIGO) and it means cancer is in pre invasive state</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1  (TNM) category means stage I (FIGO) and means that cervical cancer is limited to uterus only</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://demo.adonisbiofarma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-96e97c72.png"><img decoding="async" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" src="https://demo.adonisbiofarma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-96e97c72.png" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image courtesy: Physio pedia </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1A  (TNM) or stage IA (FIGO) means invading carcinoma has been diagnosed by microscopic or imaging screening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1A1 (TNM) means stage IA1 (FIGO) denotes a supporting tissue involvement not greater than 3mm in depth and 7mm in width.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1A2 (TNM) or IA2 (FIGO) denotes supporting tissue invasion which is between 3-5mm in depth and 7 mm in width.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1B (TNM) or IB (FIGO) denotes a clinically visible lesion involving cervix or the microscopic lesion bigger than that of T1A2/IA2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1B1 (TNM) OR IB1 (FIGO) explains a visibly marked lesion lesser than 4cm</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T1B2 (TNM) or IB2 (FIGO) means lesion size is more than 4cm</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T2 or II means tumor has invaded the areas beyond the uterus but the lower half of vagina and the pelvic wall are intact</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T2A or IIA means there is no parametrial invasion </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T2B or IIB means there is parametrial invasion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T3 or III means tumor/carcinoma has extended to pelvic wall and involvement of lower half of vagina which might result in dysfunction of kidney</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T3A or IIIA means lower half of vagina involved but pelvic walls are intact</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T3B or IIIB means involvement of pelvic wall and might cause hydronephrosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T4 or IVA means involvement of mucosa of rectum or the urinary bladder or is extends beyond the pelvis</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M1 or IVB means involvement of the distant organs of body (metastasis).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stages of cancer or the grading of cancer is strictly a clinical procedure which involves expert opinions, screening tests, clinical co relation of the evidences. For the same reason it is always advised not to interpret your reports yourself and to consult your doctor to know the exact stage of your cancer and and its prognosis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immune system protect us from viruses and infection and also play important role in resistance against the development and progressive growth of tumours. An important function of immune system in the defense against cancer is inspection and recognition of foreign substances. The immune response declines with increasing age as the number and quality of immune cells decreases and its causes a higher risk of poorer outcomes.</span></p>
<p><b>The immune system has divided into two types</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><b>Innate Immune System in Tumour Immunity:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innate immune system play important role as first line of defense against pathogens and cancers. In tumors, innate immune cells are attracted into the tumor site, where they can recognize the transformed cells. Survillances of tumor cells is mediated by receptors expressed on the surface of innate immune cells, such as NK receptors, CLRs, as well as phagocytosis receptors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White blood cells are the main type of cell responsible for protecting the body against infections. There are different types of white blood cells, and have a role in protecting the body against infections. Macrophages and mast cells recognize and destroy the target cells and initiate local tissue repair by activating vascular and fibroblast responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neutrophils are playing key role to fight with infection and protecting the body from foreign antigen to cause. The other types of white blood cells (lymphocyte, monocytes) also help fight infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dendritic cells: take up tumor antigens and migrate to lymphoid organs, where they processed peptides to T cells for the induction of specific antibody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural killer (NK) cells have cellular cross-linking between innate and adaptive immune cells Natural killer cells have the ability to interact with dendritic cells. Natural killer cells play key role to eliminate immature dendritic cells, whereas others promote dendritic cells maturation.</span></p>
<p><b>Acquired immune system:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The acquired immune system takes longer time to develop a plan of attack. The cells of adaptive immunity are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B-cells: They develop and mature in the bone marrow and make proteins called antibodies that fight viruses and bacteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T-cells: They also form in bone marrow, but mature in the thymus. There are two main types of T-cells: helper T-cells that stimulate B-cells to make antibodies, and killer T-cells that attack cells directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the immune system loses its function of recognition, tumour cells have the ability to form a tumour. Tumour cells that escape from the recognition of immune system can be explained by the following proposed mechanisms:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down regulation of major histocompatibility class (MHC) I expression &#8211; allowing antigen to go unrecognised</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loss or alteration of the MHC molecule</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunosuppressive products inhibited the body&#8217;s immune response</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tumour being immunogenic by expression of one or more antigens</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antigen modulation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tumours do not give off inflammatory warning signals.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cancer patients are more prone to get Infections</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer patients have a higher risk of infection because of changes in the immune system that help to find and attack germs that invade the body and cause infections. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer and its treatments affect the immune system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with cancer might be more likely to get infections because of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cancer itself</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain types of cancer treatment</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor nutrition</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other health problems or medications that aren&#8217;t related to cancer</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Immunotherapy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps immune system to fight cancer. The immune system helps your body fight infections and other diseases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunotherapy is biological therapy that uses substances made from living organisms to treat cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer patients have a higher risk of infection because of changes in the immune system that help to find and attack germs that invade the body and cause infections. Cancer and it&#8217;s treatments affect the immune system. Cancer can damage many parts of the immune system. The skin is an important barrier against infections and largest organ. It’s act as first line barrier to protect internal tissues from harmful germs and infections. A tumor in mucous membranes, pink lining layer of nose, eyelids vagina, digestive system, mouth &amp; throat can breakdown the natural barriers. When there is a breakdown of natural barriers, it’s very easier for foreign antigen to get into your body and cause infection. Cancer treatments (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy and surgery) and other procedures (like putting in catheters or getting shots) can injure cells in the skin or cause damage to the skin or mucous membranes. This makes it easier for germs to enter the body. Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin and multiple myeloma most types of lymphoma &amp; leukemia start in immune system blood cells. Tumors can change the immune system cells so that cells that once protected your body begin to interfere with the normal way your immune system works. Cancer cells can enter into the bone marrow cells. The cancer cells take up the space and nutrients of normal bone marrow cells. The damaged DNA in cancer cells frequently directs the mutated cell to produce abnormal proteins known as tumour antigens. These abnormal tumour proteins are foreign agent or cancer cells&#8217;. The immune system eliminates cancer cells on a daily basis but the cancer cells have the mechanisms that allow them to escape the immune responses that ordinarily prevent the development of malignant tumours. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel any problem and risk due to cancer treatment, it is temporary because the immune system function failure and it recover after a period of time and mostly it depends upon the type of cancer you are suffering. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is best to discuss your risk of getting an infection with a doctor who understands your situation and medical history. </span></p>
<p><b>Role of food and nutrient in immune system:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A diet with nutrient, herbal supplements, probiotic and prebiotic foods can boost immune function. Therefore, a diet containing probiotic and prebiotic foods may also help to boost the immune response. Probiotic foods (kefir, </span><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/yogurt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yogurt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with live active cultures, fermented vegetables, sauerkraut, tempeh, kombucha tea, kimchi, and miso ) contain live helpful bacteria, and prebiotic (garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, </span><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bananas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and seaweed) foods contain fiber and oligosaccharides that feed and maintain healthy colonies of those bacteria. Nutrients in our body work as an antioxidant to protect healthy cells, supporting growth and activity of immune cells, and producing antibodies.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cancer is an abnormal cell division/growth in our body. It can occur in any part of body and it may originate from one part and slowly spreads to another area also know as Malignant. Malignant is more problematic then benign as latter only develops in one area and treatment is also specified. Now a day, there is increase in number of Cancer patients all over the World and there are various factors which are accountable for this. We cannot stop the growth or spread by own, so we need proper medication, timely screening, nutrients intake to slow down the spread.  Like any other disease even Cancer comes with general Signs and symptoms, if we will monitor our body change or its response then Cancer can be detected early. As Cancer has various stages, so early it’s detected more earlier its treatment can be started. Cancer symptoms are not altogether different, its general symptoms and it can be differentiated only if you know your body properly.

It can occur in any part of body and it may originate from one part and slowly spreads to another area also know as Malignant. Malignant is more problematic then benign as latter only develops in one area and treatment is also specified. Now a day, there is increase in number of Cancer patients all over the World and there are various factors which are accountable for this. We cannot stop the growth or spread by own, so we need proper medication, timely screening, nutrients intake to slow down the spread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other disease even Cancer comes with general Signs and symptoms, if we will monitor our body change or its response then Cancer can be detected early. As Cancer has various stages, so early it’s detected more earlier its treatment can be started. Cancer symptoms are not altogether different, its general symptoms and it can be differentiated only if you know your body properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the general symptoms:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sudden weight loss</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular mouth ulcer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anemia</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloating or irregular bowel syndrome</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lump in breast</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakness, Tiredness, Moderate fever, Cough which keep on persisting</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above listed are general symptoms but with specific type of Cancer these symptoms changes such as in Breast cancer its lump developed in breast, prostate cancer has regular urge to urinate, Stomach or esophageal cancer ahs digestion issues always feels like heavy and unable to eat, Ovarian or Uterine cancer has irregular bleeding and pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes there are patches developed inside mouth and people think its regular mouth sore. This is common in cancer esp. in Oral cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More better we know our body, soon we will be able to make out the difference when it shows Cancer Symptoms. Those who have family history of cancer should be more careful towards these symptoms. Not all cancer comes from ancestors but few are genetic. So, it’s better to keep your physician informed about your family history and in case you found any change in your body mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t get confuse with fatigueness associated Anemia, as anemia also causes frequent fatigues and anemia is also one of the signs of cancer. Anemia makes you feel lethargic, irritated and always wants to sleep more. Monitor your hemoglobin level regularly and to maintain that have iron rich diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Signs and symptoms you can come to know, whether Cancer has spread or not, few such signs are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of constant bone pain, which is not going despite of normal pain killer medicines or exercise it indicates cancer has spared to bone. In that case regular pain killer won’t work, as it needs strong dose of medications and further screening. When cancer will spread to Brain, you will observe problem in speech, constant headache and dizziness. In this case, screening and medication needs to be changed as per spread and issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, all symptoms are general ant may only be different if proper monitoring was done. Your nutrition play important role in knowing your body. As nutritious diet or nutrient supplements makes your body internal strong and whenever you come across any changes in your body it can be easily detectable by you. Everyone nutrient demand is different depending upon age, gender, previous ailments, body type, by birth diseases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More early cancer symptoms will be tracked, more earlier you can visit your physician for further screening or diagnostic procedures. Instead of thinking whenever you come across any symptoms related to cancer start acting and visit your physician immediately. Don’t go for any test without discussing with doctors. It’s better to take someone from your family or friends who can be with you to support you emotionally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t ignore signs and symptoms which your body shows, as it may just delay in starting of treatment. Screening is another step once symptoms will be confirmed that it’s related to cancer. Screening will help in knowing the exact location in body and stage of cancer. Your physician will not start any medication or treatment on the basis of symptoms observed by you. It’s just a trigger factor to move further in knowing problem areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you are diagnosed with Cancer and your treatment is going on, still your body will show signs and symptoms. These you have to discuss with your physician as accordingly your further treatment will depend on each stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, know your body #Knowyourbody#behealthy#eathealthy</span></p>

Many patients are unable to observe any symptoms as they it as general Urinary Tract Infection Issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever any change in DNA in prostrate occurs then it results into Prostrate Cancer. Usually prostrate cancer is slow growing cancer with no symptoms or issues facing by patients. IT does not show any symptoms until it reaches advanced stage. Once it reaches advance stage it becomes dangerous, as at this stage it starts spreading to different organs. Spread to different organ from the origin organ always makes treatment more complex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostrate cancer can be treated by Hormonal therapy, Radiation, Chemotherapy, Surgery and regular medicines are also required.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSA (Prostrate Specific Antigen) is basic test which is required to know, whether you have Prostrate cancer or not. There are levels given in PSA test, which defines whether further screening or tests are required or not. PSA test is required even during treatment and post care as well. This test is required for patients having symptoms and not having symptoms. Urologist prescribes this test as an initial test to know about range. Even physical examination is required by physician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biopsy:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case PSA level is high then prostrate biopsy is required along with blood test and few marker test prescribed by physician, which helps in knowing whether it’s benign or malignant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biopsy is a procedure done in lab, it includes minor cut with needle and taking out the infectious cells to see its growth in laboratory condition. Results come in around 1 to 3 days, as not all labs are equipped to test it. In many cities, they have tie up with research centre or established laboratories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making you ready for test, your Urologist will ask you to have your Urine examination for eh chances of any Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). In case of UTI, your test will be postponed till it becomes normal. Few antibiotics are also given to avoid any infection before and after procedure.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gleason Grade starts from range 2 and go to 10 i.e. range is 2 to 10. Normally cancer range starts from 6, more less the grade lesser the spread/severity. Basis on this, urologist will prescribe further tests before starting Cancer medication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have confirmed that exact cause of Prostrate cancer is mostly unknown but diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, green leafy vegetables, proteins may decrease chances of cancer.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s technology has completely changed our lifestyle. Due to which our daily routine is becoming completely disturbed. People get stuck between their busy schedules and personal issues which affect our health, and lifestyle changes. If you do not know, then tell that it is very important to pay attention to two things for a good lifestyle, firstly the food items and secondly your<br />
routine, which has the biggest impact on your healthy life. For this you are also advised by many people to do this to change your routine… But what you do depends on your heart and mind. Because in this fast-paced life, we forget to give time to ourselves. Let us tell you in detail about it in this article, what it is and how it can be improved.</p>
<p>What is a healthy lifestyle?</p>
<p>Healthy lifestyle is good nutrition, physical activity and healthy body which leads you towards a healthy lifestyle. For this, we have to prepare many solid rules for ourselves, such as not eating fast food, minimizing the consumption of things made of sugar, keeping the bedtime right, exercising daily, staying away from worries etc. Because you can be healthy only when you adopt all these. It is not necessary that you should not change them. You can modify it as per your wish<br />
but do as much as you can. Change is the law of nature but it is better if it happens in time. Choose the right time to do each activity.</p>
<p>What is healthy lifestyle promotion day?</p>
<p>Healthy Lifestyle Promotion Day is something through which you can encourage people to lead a good lifestyle. That is why a day has been celebrated for this also. It can be any day of every month, that is, there is no fixed day for it, you can celebrate it anytime. On this day people are told that, how you can make changes in your lifestyle, because only change can keep you healthy.</p>
<p>People are encouraged more and more for these things. So that he can always improve the<br />
lifestyle.</p>
<p>Healthy lifestyle routine</p>
<p>Improvement of routine can give you a healthy and good life. Because it opens up your body, and you feel refreshed. Which is needed the most in today&#8217;s time because this running life teaches you everything but does not teach you to live a good life.

<p>Healthy Lifestyle, Healthy Diet</p>
<p>Eating less or not eating food is not dieting. Generally people believe that the reason for being fat is only food, which is absolutely wrong. Food has its own different needs. Diet is also necessary along with regular exercise and yoga to lose weight. But it means being hungry, it is absolutely wrong. A healthy diet is also very important for the body doing physical labor. If you do any kind of<br />
workout, but do not take a good diet, then in a short time you will start getting weakness and other problems will also start happening. Disease does not come in any body by speaking, but we will get what we do with our body. If you eat ludicrous food, then the body will also make you sick from inside after some time. By taking a healthy diet, you will be healthy in every walk of life. You will get the power to fight the biggest disease.</p>

The main reason for this is uncontrolled eating, mental stress, obesity, lack of exercise. That is why this disease is increasing very fast in our country.</p>
<p>This disease occurs due to the reduced secretion of insulin by the pancreas in our body. The blood glucose level rises, as well as the blood cholesterol, fat content also becomes abnormal in these patients. There are changes in the arteries. In these patients, the risk of serious, complex, fatal disease increases due to damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, brain, heart.</p>
<p>Regular diet, exercise, personal health, cleanliness and possibly insulin injections or taking prescription medications (as prescribed by the doctor) are some of the ways to prevent complications due to diabetes. But if we adopt some proper methods, then diabetes can be controlled. So here are some measures by which we can also control diseases like diabetes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Weight Management means keeping your body balanced. Keeping your weight under<br />
control in a disease like diabetes is very important because diabetes is mostly due to<br />
obesity.</li>
<li>Exercise Proper exercise helps in maintaining good health. Studies show that by<br />
exercising daily, our metabolism is also good, which also reduces the risk of diabetes.</li>
<li>Avoid Trans Fats Trans fats reduce the body&#8217;s ability to absorb proteins. Due to which there is a lack of insulin in the body. And the blood sugar level in our body increases.</li>
<li>No Sugar: Use minimum sugar in your food, it is easy to balance insulin in the body</li>
<li>Avoid refined carbohydrates: If you want to control your blood sugar, avoid white rice, pasta, popcorn, rice puffs and white flour. During diabetes the body does not know how to digest carbohydrates. Due to which sugar starts accumulating rapidly in your body.</li>
<li>Sitting in sunlight: Studies show that by sitting in the sun for a long time, you get a good amount of vitamin D which makes natural insulin in your body. If there is a deficiency of vitamin D in your body, then the level of insulin will decrease. This is an easy way to keep diabetes under control. But being in the sun too much can also lead to skin cancer.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally when anyone hears the term Breast Cancer, they think it’s only Female Cancer but to make it clear even men can have Breast Cancer. Percentage is definitely lesser then female which is around 1in 100 males but even males are not left with this disease. Breast for both genders are compiled of cells and tissues and it’s just a difference of ducts also called as mammalian ducts. Treatment is same for both male and female. It all depends how early you are diagnosed and start your treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Detection: How early you can detect cancer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For early detection Mammogram is diagnostic test which is commonly used. It helps in detecting around 2 years before tumour is felt by physician or during screening. You should always consult your physician when to go for this test. IF you have family history of Breast Cancer, you should always share in advance. In normal people this test is from 40years but with family history it should start early. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammogram is same like X-Ray, so you don’t need to panic. Benefit of early detection is survival rate become around more than 90%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home screening of breast is also useful for all patients. Your physicians shall explain you about the procedure. Although its quite simple, you have to feel lump or muscle thickening in your breast area. For better angle you can pull your arms in the back of neck and then feel your breast with Palms. Lump is painless but is hard to touch, so you can easily make out the difference. IN case you felt any lump or even if you have doubt please consult your physician immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it becomes delay in diagnosis due to early screening and social stigma of discussing about it, Still many women are not comfortable in talking about issues with their breast. They always think its nothing but just a lump and is not harmful. But remember its only you who knows your body better,, if any changes are happening in your body you will be the first one to observe it. Don’t gnore the signs which your body gives to you. As being ignorant and not expressing about issues can create major problem in future and delay in treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lump or hardness in breast area which are not painful’</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretion from nipples</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast or nipple pain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddening or swelling in breast area</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin irritation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swollen lymph nodes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nipple discharge</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any aforementioned symptoms will be observed, your physician will ask you to go for Mammogram, Ultrasound, MRI or biopsy to know about the exact cause. As these symptoms are general symptoms, so physicians’ gets confirmation only after diagnostic tests and your family history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment of Breast Cancer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not necessary that you will be detected with breast cancer in both breasts. It always start with single breast. Treatment depends upon stage wherein it’s detected and then it can be treated with chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy and surgery. Along with that medicines and timely screening is also required. Surgery and radiation are used to treat breast cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While treating with above mentioned, it does not affect other organ of body. Medicines can have side effects, which can make you week or anorexic or anaemic. So, your doctor will prescribe you nutrient supplement and will share diet chart as well. Your healthy body will always makes your fight against much easier. You have to follow all instruction carefully for maximum positive effect of medicines and treatments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your physician will discuss about each treatment, medicines, duration of treatment before your start of therapy. Keep faith on yourself, doctor and most important always remain positive. Remember breast cancer is curable if proper care and early detection takes place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relapse is also common with Breast cancer, so even if you are successfully recovered still proper post recovery test and follow ups are required. In any day you feel same type of signs in your body, immediately consult your physician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting with any type of cancer brings lots of emotional stress, financial burden and fear about survival. All these are normal for any human beings, as you can’t control your though process. But, you should always try to convert these factors or to use these energy channels in your fight against cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy mind and body can do wonder.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is nutrition and its use in cancer?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition is nutrient derived from your foods. Our daily food consists of protein, Carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. Healthy body uses this nutrition as per their requirement and demand e.g. if you work out your body needs more protein then carbohydrates. Similarly during Cancer, its requirement and need increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water/liquid fluids is essential part of body and if you consume less water you will be dehydrated that will slowly impact your organ. So, always drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated and to eject out unnecessary items from body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition demand of body keeps on changing throughout life. If a person is diagnosed with Cancer, there will be change in diet pattern not only during treatment but after that as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can Cancer be treated with Nutrition?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment of Cancer is a sequence of medications, therapy, tests, diets, proper care and timely examination. Its not singly dependent on one of the factors but is a combination of all the above listed parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of that definitely nutrition is one of it, as its required not only during the treatment but even after patient is recovered. As Cancer may relapsed either in same organ of origin and sometimes in different organ, that’s why post cancer nutrition/diet maintenance is equally important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer leads to Anorexia and Cachexia both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anorexia means loss of appetite. It can happen before diagnosis as well, but its severity increases with each day/ cancer treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cachexia means loss of weight, muscle loss and patient becomes weak. It happens due to anorexia or body not getting adequate nutrition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer medications and treatment such as Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Transplant, Blood transfusions, Hormone therapy, Radiation Therapy makes body weak and more prone to infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition is equally important as cancer treatment i.e. both should go hand in hand. Nutrition can be derived from food but for faster action many nutritionist prescribes nutrition supplements. These supplements makes treatment more effective as body becomes healthier and fight against any odds. Major issue which comes is decrease in Haemoglobin due to Cancer and its medication. Maintaining Haemoglobin is really necessity as to have doses of Chemotherapy, Haemoglobin should be in range, which differs from age wise and gender wise. If its not in range, doctors won’t go ahead for further dose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase Haemoglobin during Chemotherapy doctors either gives medicines or transfer of blood units as per requirement. This sometimes takes time to come to normal range and to re-start Chemotherapy. So, having proper nutrition since beginning is really helpful in maintaining it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all the body requirements during and after treatment nutrient demand also changes. Before medication start, body has to fight only with cancer physically and emotionally. During treatment, fight it against dreadful disease and side effects of medicines. All individuals reacts differently with cancer medicines or we can say each one is different. Here your nutrition and healthy diet plans massive role.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malnutrition is another such issue which comes with Cancer which occurs due to inefficient supply and demand meets of body. As during Cancer, patient willingness to eat or appetite goes away. Once patient is malnourished, it becomes tough to fight against cancer or to have positive effect of cancer medicines. Malnutrition often leads to loss of appetite, severe weakness, paleness, fatigue, irritability, dizziness and many other weakness forms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your healthcare or physicians needs to know following before making any change in your diet:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your daily routine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your diet chart</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time when you take nutritious diets such as proteins, Vitamins or supplements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already taking any supplements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight Changes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change in food habit during recent times</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">History of cancer in family</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping pattern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMI (Basal Metabolic Index)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food preference</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few more</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining proper diet pan is beneficial in this journey and that you can experience yourself slowly once your body will start acting on medicines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just remember, during initial days of initiation of cancer treatment your body will not show any changes it will just be physiological or emotional effect. Later on your body will receive medicines and as per stage of cancer it reacts differently. Stage also plays major role in treatment, diet plan, care, medicines and tests. Its always advisable to discuss fully with your healthcare professional about disease, medications, cost of treatment, medical insurance, time, chances of relapse and most important nutrient supplements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nutrition’s helps you in making your body healthy, strong and less prone to infection but its your will power as well which helps you to make this path less painful. As once you will be recovered, you can easily set examples for others about benefits of Nutritious diet.</span></p>
